# RetentionTimeObserver
The Retention Time Observer is an application developped as part of the European project Waternomics. It aims to observe the time during which water has been residing in a pipe and creates an alarm when the time exceeds a certain time to ask a manager to flash the water and make sure it is fresh and safe to drink.
